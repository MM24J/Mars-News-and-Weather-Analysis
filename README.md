# Mars_Web_Scraping

This challenge involved scraping and examining the HTML elements of the _Mars News_[  ](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html)https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html and _Mars Temperature Data_[  ](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html websites utilizing Spinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to extract the HTML code. The information from the news site was stored in a Python list of dictionaries, and the temperature data was stored in a Pandas dataframe. The Mars data was analyzed through summary statistics and by creating plots.

I relied on the class material, office hours, and Slack channel for support, and used Stack Overflow for troubleshooting.
